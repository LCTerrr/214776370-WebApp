        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the ever-evolving lanscape of technologym the risk of Artificia Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the way we work. From automation to advanced data analysis, AI has profound implications for the future of employment.</p>

        <ul>
            <p>While automation may lead to job displacement in certain sectors, there is a growing emphasis on upskilling and reskilling the workplace. Organizations are investing in programs to train employees in new skills, prepairing them for the jobs of the future that require a combination of technical and soft skills.</p>
        </ul>
        <p><em><b>Ai Collaboration in the Workplace</b></em></p>
        <ul>
