        <p><em>What is IT (Information Technology)?</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Information technology, or IT, is the utilization of computers, networking, data storage and connected
                devices, along with the infrastructure and processes involved, to facilitate business or administrative
                solutions. IT professionals are required to have deep knowledge of how devices are connected, not only
                understanding best practices to ensure success across organizations, but also creating new and innovative
                solutions specific to a company's given infrastructure. </p></li>
